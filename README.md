# Machine-Learning-Practical
Main assignment related to predicting the quality of physical exercises on unlabelled data.

Overall, the analysis shows that random forest performs a better job in delineating the features that represent the best predictors for the quality of the exercise.
roll_belt, pitch_belt,yaw_belt, magnet_dumbbell_y, magnet_dumbbell_z, roll_forearm, pitch_forearm are the most important predictors based on Random forest (see the graph aside from the html file).
